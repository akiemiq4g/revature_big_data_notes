An orphan record is a record with a reference to another record that does not exist — for example, an order record that references a customer record that does not exist.\n",

These foreign key-primary key pairings form the basis for table relationships and multi-table queries. It’s important that these foreign key-primary key references stay synchronized. Referential integrity, which is dependent on table relationships, helps ensure that references stay synchronized.\n",

There are two goals of the normalization process: eliminating redundant data (for example, storing the same data in more than one table) and ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table). Both of these are worthy goals as they reduce the amount of space a database consumes and ensure that data is logically stored.\n",
